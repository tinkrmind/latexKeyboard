Arduino leonardo based latex keyboard to make typing easier.

I used soft touch keyboard like [this](https://www.amazon.com/CHENBO-Universial-Switch-Keypad-Keyboard/dp/B078JDP442/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1520462531&sr=8-2-spons&keywords=4x4+keypad&psc=1) one. The Circuit is pretty simple, with the foure wires corresponding to rows of the keyboard connected to arduino leonardo pins 4, 5, 6, 7 and the four pins corresponding to coloumns connected to pins 8, 9, 10, 11. There is no other conenctions/components needed. The code is compatible with arduino micro as well.
